The repository includes the following notebooks:

**door_game**: it contains a simple Python code presented in the article [*O jogo das portas do Silvio Santos (tamb√©m conhecido como o problema de Monty Hall)*](https://eduardofmdcosta.github.io/posts/2023-06-30-jogo-das-portas.html).

**energy_ml**: it is one of my first ML-related notebooks, part of an activity proposed by Prof. Aurelie Fischer (LPSM) in the Introduction to Machine Learning course at University of Paris. It basically fits multiple ML models to a proprietary dataset with energy data.
